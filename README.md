## Details
Adds custom items to the WaniKani language-learning website. Main features:
- Where possible, intercepts and modifies WK Fetch calls to maintain compatibility with other scripts.
- Google Drive API integration, to enable cross-device sync (WIP).
- Stores and integrates custom Radicals, Kanji, and Vocabulary into the WK SRS system.
- System to capture, on a rotating basis, one WaniKani review. This allows keeping the review page of the website always active and therefore allows reviewing custom items even when WaniKani items are not available.
